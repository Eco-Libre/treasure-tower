TODO

 * add stairs down to the first WC
 * add compost unloading platform outside the second-floor maintenance door (the first door above ground level that's ~1m above the ground level) that pours into a hopper for collection in a wheelbarrow or tractor trailer at ground-level
 * add sinks
 * add half-basement (?) so first deposit closet is ground-level
 * add roof
 * add doors
 * add windows (except sheer walls)
 * figure out the thickness of the walls, which affects the footprint of the buildings and wall-to-wall clearance of all the rooms
  - after setting wall thickness, confirm that the wall-to-wall clearance of every room meets our requirements
 * add WCs on second and third floor. Don't add one to the 5th floor (there's no vertical) and also don't add one to the 4th floor (this gives us additional capacity for storing the pallets as they compost; I calculate it increases from 78 pallets to 108 pallets [double-stacked where possible], which is enough for 30 people [filling one pallet every 7 days] and 2 years of compost time [double most recommendations])
 * make the ramps 1.5 meters wide and all the landings 1.8 meters wide (turning space), to accommodate wheelchair users https://www.iwa.ie/access-guidelines/great-outdoors-access-guidelines/7-access-to-the-built-environment/
    - also check turning radius needed for a hydraulic hand-truck pulling a standard Euro pallet (1.2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, 1 meter tall) https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/60826/warehouse-aisles-and-ramp-requirements-for-pallet-hand-trucks
